| * Code for Convex Hull using jarvis march and         |
|   Graham scan                                         |

| * The CODE                                            |
|   - ConvexHull.java: contains all the code            |
|                                                       |
| * Running                                             |
|   - run 'make clean' to remove any build files        |
|   - run 'make' to compile the code                    |
|   - run 'make run' to run the code, the code executes |
|     a function call test() that checks for            |
|     correctness, followed by a function that runs the |
|     simulations.                                      |
